# A5-sirius-and-xtext
The assignment focuses on the development of textual and graphical editors related to the identified domain. It requires the realization of several tasks by using the following frameworks: xText - Sirius.
The assignment aims to understand the acquired competencies about the considered technologies. Because of the complexity of such technologies, we are asking for straightforward editor implementations that partially cover the concepts defined at the metamodel level.
## Task A4.1
Define a complete concrete syntax for the metamodel defined in A2 by using xText. The concrete syntax should cover all the concepts defined at the metamodel level.
Suggestion: feel free to reuse and refine the default concrete syntax provided by xText wizard.
## Task A4.2
Define a straightforward graphical editor to visualize and edit your domain models by using Sirius. In this task, we ask for a dummy graphical editor that partially covers your domain metamodel concepts. In other words, the graphical editor should provide the representations for some metamodel concepts and the involved relations. Try to include at least the following Sirius features:
- Node representations,
- Edge representations (both relation-based and element-based), and
- Palette operators to create such nodes and edges.
